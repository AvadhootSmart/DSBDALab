Preparing for your Data Science and Big Data Analytics practical exam as a newbie can feel overwhelming, but since you’re already familiar with development, you can leverage your coding skills to grasp Python-based data science concepts quickly. I’ll break down the curriculum into actionable steps, focusing on the key operations for each assignment, and provide concise explanations and code snippets tailored for a beginner. The goal is to give you a clear path to practice and understand the essentials for your exam tomorrow. Let’s dive into each assignment and prioritize what’s critical.
Group B: Assignments Overview
The assignments focus on:

    Data manipulation (using Python on datasets like Facebook metrics).
    Data preprocessing and modeling (on Air Quality and Heart Diseases datasets).
    Big Data with Hadoop (using PyHadoop and Hive on the forest fire dataset).
    Data visualization (using Python libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn for assignments 2 and 3).
    Tableau visualization (on Adult and Iris datasets).

Since you’re new to data science, I’ll emphasize Python-based tasks (assignments 1, 2, and 4) because they’re foundational and likely easier to pick up with your dev background. For Hadoop (assignment 3) and Tableau (assignment 5), I’ll provide high-level guidance, as these may require specific setups that are harder to practice in one day without prior exposure.
Assignment 1: Data Manipulation on Facebook Metrics Dataset
Dataset: Facebook metrics (likely available from UCI or Kaggle; contains metrics like likes, shares, comments).
Tasks:

    Create data subsets
    Merge data
    Sort data
    Transpose data
    Shape and reshape data

Key Library: Pandas (for data manipulation).
Steps and Code:

    Setup: Install Pandas if not already done (pip install pandas). Load the dataset (assume it’s a CSV file).
    Practice the operations:
    python

    import pandas as pd

    # Load dataset
    df = pd.read_csv('facebook_metrics.csv')  # Replace with actual file path

    # a. Create data subsets
    subset1 = df[['Page total likes', 'Post Month']]  # Select specific columns
    subset2 = df[df['Post Month'] == 12]  # Filter rows (e.g., December posts)
    print("Subset 1:\n", subset1.head())
    print("Subset 2:\n", subset2.head())

    # b. Merge data (create two subsets and merge)
    subset3 = df[['Page total likes', 'Post Month']].iloc[:50]
    subset4 = df[['Post Month', 'Lifetime Post Total Reach']].iloc[:50]
    merged_df = pd.merge(subset3, subset4, on='Post Month', how='inner')
    print("Merged Data:\n", merged_df.head())

    # c. Sort data
    sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='Lifetime Post Total Reach', ascending=False)
    print("Sorted Data:\n", sorted_df.head())

    # d. Transpose data
    transposed_df = df.transpose()
    print("Transposed Data:\n", transposed_df.head())

    # e. Shape and reshape data
    print("Shape:", df.shape)  # Rows, Columns
    # Reshape using pivot (example: pivot by Post Month and Type)
    reshaped_df = df.pivot_table(index='Post Month', columns='Type', values='Lifetime Post Total Reach', aggfunc='mean')
    print("Reshaped Data:\n", reshaped_df.head())

Tips:

    Understand: Subsets are like filtering rows/columns. Merging combines datasets based on a key (like SQL joins). Sorting orders data. Transposing flips rows and columns. Reshaping (e.g., pivot) reorganizes data for analysis.
    Practice: Download the Facebook metrics dataset (search UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle). Run the code above in a Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE. Tweak column names based on the actual dataset.
    Exam Focus: Be ready to explain what each operation does and why it’s useful (e.g., sorting to find top-performing posts).

Assignment 2: Data Preprocessing and Modeling on Air Quality and Heart Diseases Datasets
Datasets: Air Quality (e.g., pollution metrics) and Heart Diseases (e.g., patient health data).
Tasks:

    Data cleaning
    Data integration
    Data transformation
    Error correcting
    Data model building

Key Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
Steps and Code:

    Setup: Install required libraries (pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn).
    Practice the operations:
    python

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Load dataset (example: Heart Disease)
    df = pd.read_csv('heart_disease.csv')  # Replace with actual file path

    # a. Data cleaning
    # Remove missing values
    df_cleaned = df.dropna()
    # Replace invalid values (e.g., negative age)
    df_cleaned = df_cleaned[df_cleaned['age'] > 0]
    print("Cleaned Data:\n", df_cleaned.head())

    # b. Data integration
    # Example: Merge with another dataset (e.g., patient demographics)
    df_demo = pd.read_csv('demographics.csv')  # Hypothetical second dataset
    integrated_df = pd.merge(df_cleaned, df_demo, on='patient_id', how='inner')
    print("Integrated Data:\n", integrated_df.head())

    # c. Data transformation
    # Normalize numerical columns (e.g., cholesterol levels)
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    df_cleaned['chol_scaled'] = scaler.fit_transform(df_cleaned[['chol']])
    # Encode categorical variables (e.g., sex)
    df_cleaned['sex'] = df_cleaned['sex'].map({'male': 1, 'female': 0})
    print("Transformed Data:\n", df_cleaned.head())

    # d. Error correcting
    # Example: Cap outliers (e.g., cholesterol > 600)
    df_cleaned['chol'] = df_cleaned['chol'].clip(upper=600)
    print("Error Corrected Data:\n", df_cleaned.head())

    # e. Data model building (e.g., predict heart disease)
    X = df_cleaned[['age', 'chol_scaled', 'sex']]  # Features
    y = df_cleaned['target']  # Target (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)

Tips:

    Understand:
        Cleaning: Remove missing values, handle duplicates, or filter invalid data.
        Integration: Combine multiple datasets (like merging patient records).
        Transformation: Scale numerical data (e.g., normalization) or encode categories (e.g., one-hot encoding).
        Error Correcting: Fix outliers or inconsistent entries.
        Modeling: Build a simple model (e.g., Logistic Regression for classification).
    Practice: Find the UCI Heart Disease dataset and Air Quality dataset online. Run the code, adjusting column names. Focus on cleaning and modeling, as they’re common exam tasks.
    Exam Focus: Know how to handle missing values and build a basic model. Be ready to explain preprocessing steps.

Assignment 3: Integrate Python and Hadoop (Forest Fire Dataset)
Tasks:

    Data analysis using MapReduce in PyHadoop.
    Data mining in Hive.

Key Tools: Hadoop, PyHadoop, Hive.
Guidance (High-Level, as Hadoop setup is complex):

    MapReduce with PyHadoop:
        Concept: MapReduce processes large datasets in parallel. The "Map" phase transforms data, and the "Reduce" phase aggregates it.
        Example Task: Count forest fire occurrences by month.
        Sample Code (simplified, assuming Hadoop is set up):
        python

        from mrjob.job import MRJob

        class FireCount(MRJob):
            def mapper(self, _, line):
                # Assume CSV: month,day,temp,wind,area_burned
                fields = line.split(',')
                month = fields[0]
                yield month, 1

            def reducer(self, month, counts):
                yield month, sum(counts)

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            FireCount.run()

        Note: Running this requires a Hadoop cluster or local setup, which may not be feasible in one day. Instead, understand the logic: Map extracts key-value pairs, Reduce aggregates.
    Data Mining in Hive:
        Concept: Hive is a SQL-like interface for querying Hadoop data.
        Example Task: Query total area burned by month.
        Sample Query:
        sql

        CREATE TABLE forest_fires (month STRING, day STRING, temp FLOAT, wind FLOAT, area FLOAT)
        ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
        LOAD DATA INPATH 'forestfires.csv' INTO TABLE forest_fires;
        SELECT month, SUM(area) as total_area_burned
        FROM forest_fires
        GROUP BY month;

        Note: Hive requires a Hadoop environment. Focus on understanding SQL-like syntax.

Tips:

    Understand: MapReduce splits tasks into map (transform) and reduce (aggregate). Hive queries data like a database.
    Practice: If you don’t have Hadoop, study the code and logic. If you have access to a lab setup, try running the MapReduce job or Hive query.
    Exam Focus: Be ready to explain MapReduce steps or write a simple Hive query. If asked to code, focus on the mapper/reducer logic.

Assignment 4: Visualize Data for Assignments 2 and 3
Datasets: Air Quality, Heart Diseases, Forest Fire.
Task: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
Key Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Steps and Code:
python

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset (example: Heart Disease)

df = pd.read_csv('heart_disease.csv')

# Bar plot: Average cholesterol by sex

sns.barplot(x='sex', y='chol', data=df)
plt.title('Average Cholesterol by Sex')
plt.show()

# Scatter plot: Age vs Cholesterol

plt.scatter(df['age'], df['chol'], c=df['target'], cmap='coolwarm')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Cholesterol')
plt.title('Age vs Cholesterol (Colored by Heart Disease)')
plt.show()

# Heatmap: Correlation matrix

corr = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='Blues')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

# For Forest Fire (example): Area burned by month

df_fire = pd.read_csv('forestfires.csv')
sns.boxplot(x='month', y='area', data=df_fire)
plt.title('Area Burned by Month')
plt.show()

Tips:

    Understand: Bar plots show aggregates, scatter plots show relationships, heatmaps show correlations, and box plots show distributions.
    Practice: Run the code with your datasets. Experiment with different plot types (e.g., line plots for Air Quality trends).
    Exam Focus: Know how to create and interpret basic plots. Be ready to explain what insights the visualization provides.

Assignment 5: Data Visualization in Tableau (Adult and Iris Datasets)
Datasets: Adult (income data), Iris (flower species).
Tasks: Various visualization types (1D, 2D, 3D, temporal, multidimensional, tree, network).
Guidance (High-Level, as Tableau is GUI-based):

    Tableau Basics:
        Setup: Use Tableau Public (free) if available. Load datasets (CSV files).
        Visualizations:
            1D (Linear): Histogram of income (Adult) or petal length (Iris).
            2D (Planar): Scatter plot of age vs income (Adult) or petal length vs width (Iris).
            3D (Volumetric): 3D scatter plot (e.g., age, income, hours-per-week). Use Tableau’s 3D capabilities or simulate with color/size.
            Temporal: Line chart of data over time (if available, e.g., synthetic time data).
            Multidimensional: Combine multiple variables (e.g., age, income, education) in a dashboard.
            Tree/Hierarchical: Treemap of income by occupation (Adult).
            Network: Network graph of relationships (less common for these datasets; may need synthetic data).
        How to Do It: Drag fields to Rows/Columns in Tableau. Use “Show Me” to select chart types. Adjust colors, filters, and labels.

Tips:

    Understand: Each visualization type serves a purpose (e.g., histograms for distributions, scatter for relationships).
    Practice: If you have Tableau, load the Iris dataset and try a scatter plot or histogram. If not, watch a quick Tableau tutorial (YouTube) to understand the interface.
    Exam Focus: Be ready to describe how to create a visualization in Tableau or interpret a given chart.

Preparation Plan for Tomorrow
Since time is short, prioritize based on your comfort with coding and access to tools:

    Today (Evening):
        Focus on Assignments 1 and 2: Run the Python code for data manipulation and preprocessing. Use Jupyter Notebook for quick testing. Download the datasets (Facebook metrics, Heart Disease, Air Quality) from UCI or Kaggle.
        Visualization (Assignment 4): Practice basic Matplotlib/Seaborn plots. Focus on scatter, bar, and heatmap.
        Review Assignment 3: Study the MapReduce and Hive examples. Understand the logic without running (unless you have Hadoop).
        Tableau (Assignment 5): If you have Tableau, try one or two visualizations. If not, read about visualization types and their purposes.
    Tomorrow (Morning):
        Re-run key Python code snippets to build confidence.
        Review notes on Hadoop and Tableau concepts.
