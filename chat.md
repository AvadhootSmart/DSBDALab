Perfect! This is super clear. ðŸ”¥  
You have two major parts:  
1. **Big Data Tools (Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive, PyHadoop)**  
2. **Data Science Tools (Python pandas, visualization with matplotlib/seaborn/Tableau)**

---

### Here's how we can prepare:

I'll quickly break down **what you need to know** + **important viva questions** for each practical.

---

## Group A: Big Data (Hadoop + Hive + PyHadoop)

### 1. Single/Multiple node Hadoop Installation
- **Know:**
  - Hadoop works in 3 modes: Local, Pseudo-distributed, Fully distributed.
  - For Pseudo: Only 1 machine behaves like a cluster (localhost setup).
  - Hadoop core daemons: NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager.

- **Viva Questions:**
  - What is the difference between Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2 (YARN)?
  - What files are edited for Hadoop installation? (core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, mapred-site.xml, yarn-site.xml)
  - What is the role of NameNode and DataNode?

---

### 2. MapReduce Program to process log file (Java)
- **Know:**
  - Map function: Parses logs and emits `<user_id, login_duration>`.
  - Reduce function: Aggregates total duration per user and finds max.
  - Input: Log file (timestamp, user ID, login/logout times).
  - Output: User(s) with maximum login period.

- **Viva Questions:**
  - What is the basic flow of MapReduce?
  - Difference between Mapper and Reducer?
  - What is Combiner? Why is it used?
  - How is data transferred between Map and Reduce phases?

---

### 3. HiveQL (Flight Information System)
- **Know:**
  - Hive is a SQL-like tool built on top of Hadoop.
  - External table: Doesn't move data into Hive warehouse.
  - Indexing helps speed up queries.

- **Viva Questions:**
  - Difference between Managed Table and External Table?
  - How is Hive different from RDBMS?
  - What is Partitioning and Bucketing in Hive?
  - Syntax: `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`.

---

## Group B: Data Analytics using Python

### 1. Facebook Metrics Dataset (DataFrame Operations)
- **Know:**
  - `subset = df[['column1', 'column2']]`
  - `merged = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key')`
  - `sorted = df.sort_values(by='column')`
  - `df.T` for transpose
  - `df.shape`, `df.melt()`, `df.pivot()`

- **Viva Questions:**
  - What is the difference between `merge` and `join` in pandas?
  - What is reshaping data? Examples?

---

### 2. Air Quality and Heart Disease Dataset
- **Know:**
  - Data cleaning: Handling NaN values (`df.dropna()`, `df.fillna()`).
  - Data integration: Merging/joining datasets.
  - Data transformation: Scaling, encoding (LabelEncoding/OneHotEncoding).
  - Error correcting: Removing outliers, fixing wrong labels.

- **Viva Questions:**
  - What techniques are used for missing data?
  - What is normalization vs standardization?

---

### 3. Python + Hadoop Integration (PyHadoop)
- **Know:**
  - Running MapReduce using Python scripts.
  - Example: Wordcount program in PyHadoop.

- **Viva Questions:**
  - What is PyHadoop?
  - Can Python programs run on Hadoop framework?

---

### 4. Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, Tableau)
- **Python (matplotlib/seaborn):**
  - `plt.plot()`, `plt.scatter()`, `plt.bar()`
  - `sns.heatmap()`, `sns.pairplot()`, etc.

- **Tableau:**
  - Know different types of visualizations.
  - Drag and drop concept.
  - Dimensions vs Measures.

- **Viva Questions:**
  - What is the difference between 1D, 2D, 3D, and Temporal Visualization?
  - What is a Heatmap?
  - Difference between bar chart and histogram?

# Quick Practical Preparation Tips:
âœ… Revise Hadoop commands (`hdfs dfs -put`, `hdfs dfs -ls`, etc.)  
âœ… Review basic Python pandas operations (subset, merge, clean)  
âœ… Look at basic matplotlib plots (`plt.plot`, `sns.barplot`)  
âœ… Memorize basic HiveQL queries (`CREATE TABLE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`)  
âœ… Go over Tableau basic visualizations (Pie chart, Scatter plot, Line plot)
