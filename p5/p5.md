Assignment 2: Data Preprocessing and Modeling on Air Quality and Heart Diseases Datasets
Datasets: Air Quality (e.g., pollution metrics) and Heart Diseases (e.g., patient health data).
Tasks:
Data cleaning

Data integration

Data transformation

Error correcting

Data model building

Key Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.

Steps and Code:
Setup: Install required libraries (pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn).

Tips:
Understand:
Cleaning: Remove missing values, handle duplicates, or filter invalid data.

Integration: Combine multiple datasets (like merging patient records).

Transformation: Scale numerical data (e.g., normalization) or encode categories (e.g., one-hot encoding).

Error Correcting: Fix outliers or inconsistent entries.

Modeling: Build a simple model (e.g., Logistic Regression for classification).

Practice: Find the UCI Heart Disease dataset and Air Quality dataset online. Run the code, adjusting column names. Focus on cleaning and modeling, as theyâ€™re common exam tasks.

Exam Focus: Know how to handle missing values and build a basic model. Be ready to explain preprocessing steps.
