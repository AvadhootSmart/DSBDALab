Assignment 1: Data Manipulation on Facebook Metrics Dataset
Dataset: Facebook metrics (likely available from UCI or Kaggle; contains metrics like likes, shares, comments).
Tasks:
Create data subsets

Merge data

Sort data

Transpose data

Shape and reshape data

Key Library: Pandas (for data manipulation).
Steps and Code:
Setup: Install Pandas if not already done (pip install pandas). Load the dataset (assume it’s a CSV file).

Tips:
Understand: Subsets are like filtering rows/columns. Merging combines datasets based on a key (like SQL joins). Sorting orders data. Transposing flips rows and columns. Reshaping (e.g., pivot) reorganizes data for analysis.

Practice: Download the Facebook metrics dataset (search UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle). Run the code above in a Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE. Tweak column names based on the actual dataset.

Exam Focus: Be ready to explain what each operation does and why it’s useful (e.g., sorting to find top-performing posts).
